Clone of facebook home page
<<<<<<< HEAD
I have used HTML and CSS in creating this clone of the facebook home page. I have tried to copy the webpage as much as possible.<br> 
This is the image that I used to clone the page.
<img src="./images/original.png>

This is the image of my clone.
<img src="./images/final.png>

Evidently, there are lots oif areas of improvement which will be made once I have more expertise over these languages.

Future enhancements will be there soon.

Some of the icons were downloaded from: [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/).<br>
